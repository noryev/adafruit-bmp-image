This repo is dedicated to circuit python code that runs a slideshow on a ESP32 Microcontroller and a 250x250 display using .bmp images saved within a images folder on the device.

# Instructions to get this working! 
First I am using a Adafruit Funhouse IOT Home Automation Board(Uses ESP32 Microcontroller). (found here)[https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-funhouse]

I am using CircuitPython for this project instead of the ArduinoIDE! 

## Base Board OS Install 

(Adafruit Installing MU editor)[https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-funhouse/installing-mu-editor] Download and install MU

## Install Libraries and install code from python file

(Instructions found here:)[https://learn.adafruit.com/creating-slideshows-in-circuitpython/load-the-software]

## Project Changes/Features

1. Wirelessly transmitting 250x250 .bmp images to the microcontroller over wifi? POSSIBLE?
2. Program to process NASA API to pull image, then, convert image to .bmp file, then upload to microcontroller.
